# American-Sign-Language-Letter-Classification
Sign languages provide a way to communicate without the use of voice. This is very important for individuals with impaired hearing and inability to speak because it gives an alternative means of communicating with others. Furthermore, sign language is a universal language that allows people of different speaking languages to communicate which is very important.

Our goal is to develop an algorithm that can generate English alphabets based on sign language symbols. 
It should recognize the hand symbols and predict the correct corresponding alphabet through sign language classification.

In this project we will train a convolutional neural network to classify images of American sign language letters, after loading, examining, and preprocessing the data, we will train the network and test its performance on unseen images.
